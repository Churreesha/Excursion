# Excursion
Created a web page which advertises a fictional product called “Excursion.”
Using HTML, CSS, Command Line Interface, and Git.
The web page advertises a mobile app which helps users record and share their experiences.
Using video and landscape imagery to set the scene.
A landing page is a vital tool in marketing a product and the goal will be to convince potential customers into using the product.
